        # Let's adjust to check mana gain within _begin_turn_phase if possible, or be specific about turn end.
        # The current assertion is for mana *after* _begin_turn_phase effects of the *new* turn.
        # After execute_full_turn (which was Turn 1), player mana is 0.
        # Then, if another turn starts (Turn 2), mana would be 2.

        # For simplicity, given the current structure: player.mana will be 0 at the end of execute_full_turn.
        # The original assertion was `assert player.mana >= 1`. This would only be true *during* the turn, not at the very end.

        # So, after execute_full_turn, player.mana should be 0.
        # The test seems to expect mana to be present.
        # Perhaps the check `assert player.mana >=1` implies the beginning of the *next* turn after the one executed.
        # This is confusing. Let's assume the spirit of the test is that mana was gained and available during the turn.
