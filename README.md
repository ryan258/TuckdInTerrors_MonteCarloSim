## 🎲 Usage Examples

### Basic Game Simulation

```python
from tuck_in_terrors_sim.game_logic.game_setup import initialize_new_game
from tuck_in_terrors_sim.game_elements.data_loaders import load_all_game_data

# Load game content
game_data = load_all_game_data()
objective = game_data.get_objective_by_id("OBJ01_THE_FIRST_NIGHT")

# Initialize a new game
game_state = initialize_new_game(objective, game_data.cards_by_id)

# Game is ready for simulation
print(f"Game initialized with {len(game_state.cards_in_play)} cards in play")
```

### Custom AI Implementation

```python
from tuck_in_terrors_sim.ai.ai_player_base import AIPlayerBase

class StrategicAI(AIPlayerBase):
    def decide_action(self, game_state, possible_actions):
        # Prioritize playing cheap toys early
        toy_plays = [a for a in possible_actions
                    if a.type == "PLAY_CARD" and "Toy" in a.description]
        if toy_plays:
            return min(toy_plays, key=lambda a: self._get_card_cost(a))
